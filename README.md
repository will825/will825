Hi, I’m Will 
Linux-focused technologist building monitoring, logging, and automation systems using Python and Raspberry Pi.
I specialize in designing and deploying real-time infrastructure tools in Linux environments using systemd, journald, REST APIs, and structured logging.
I enjoy solving operational problems, improving system visibility, and building tools that make infrastructure more reliable.
Currently seeking remote entry-level roles in IT, infrastructure, NOC, or automation-focused environments.

 Featured Projects

 SysMon Dashboard
