# Hi, I'm Will  
**Python Developer | Audio Engineer | Creative Technologist**

I’m an audio engineer and technologist with a strong interest in software
development, automation, and hardware-based tools.

I enjoy building practical systems that connect sound, code, and physical
interfaces — ranging from MIDI utilities and audio workflow tools to
Raspberry Pi–based hardware projects.

###  About Me
Nature lover, problem-solver, and builder.
I enjoy creating tools that improve people’s experiences and blending
technology with sound in practical, thoughtful ways.

###  Current Focus
- Raspberry Pi development using GPIO
- Python scripting for automation and tooling
- Sensors, servos, and hardware interaction
- Designing software that interfaces with physical systems

###  Audio & Media Systems
- MIDI tooling and controller logic
- Algorithmic music and chord generation
- Audio workflow automation
- Experimental interfaces for sound and control

###  Software & Hardware Skills
- Python
- Raspberry Pi / GPIO
- Hardware prototyping (breadboards, sensors, servos)
- MIDI and audio systems
- Linux / Raspberry Pi OS
- Git & GitHub
- Basic electronics and signal flow concepts

###  Selected Projects
- **Raspberry Pi Ultrasonic Radar** – Servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor with real-time visualization
- **MIDI Tools** – Python-based MIDI utilities and generators
- **Hardware Experiments** – Raspberry Pi GPIO-based projects and prototypes
